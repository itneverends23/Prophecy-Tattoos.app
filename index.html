        <ul>
          <li>DO NOT scratch or pick at the tattoo.</li>
          <li>DO NOT go swimming or immerse your body in water (showers are fine)</li>
        </ul>
        		<ol>
           	 	<li>Take a sheet of paper towel and damp it lightly with warm water.</li>
            	<li>Apply a small amount of antibacterial unscented soap on the sheet of paper towel.</li>
            	<li>Gently exfoliate the skin to remove dry blood, bacterial, dead cells preventing infections</li>
            	<li>Take a new paper towel and dap the tattoo dry, gently drying the tattoo</li>
            	<li>Take 1cm worth of aquaphor and apply it gently to the skin</li>
           		<li>Take a sheet of paper towel and wipe all the excess aquaphor (the skin absorbs all that it can in 20 min)</li>
         	 </ol>
          <br>
          	<ul>
            	<li>Repeat this process when the tattoo feels dry and there is a need to clean</li>
            	<li>AD Ointment helps cure the bottom layer of the skin but it can also take the ink out of the skin</li>
